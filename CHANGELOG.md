## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Six new tools: Hex, URL encode/decode, JWT inspection (no signature verification), Hash (MD5 + SHA-1/256/384/512 via Web Crypto, labelled where non-cryptographic), Defang/refang IOCs, and a Timestamp converter (Unix, Windows FILETIME, human date-times in UTC and Europe/Amsterdam) — each with test vectors.
- Modular theme system with four built-in themes (Terminal, Slate, Frost, High contrast), each with dark and light modes, switchable from the top bar and designed so future plugins can register their own.
- Inline-SVG tool icons, a console-style home landing, and a terminal-style input/output surface for tools.

### Changed

- Redesigned the app shell into a two-pane analyst-console layout and replaced the theme control with a clear light/dark (sun/moon) toggle that follows the system preference by default.
